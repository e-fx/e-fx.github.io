"The USD/JPY faced renewed downward pressure, dipping back into the mid-145 yen range"

In the New York foreign exchange market today, the USD/JPY faced renewed downward pressure, dipping back into the mid-145 yen range. Early in the day, the release of July's U.S. PCE data led to an initial response of dollar selling. Although the USD/JPY did touch the mid-145 yen range, it was quick to recover.

While the PCE deflator suggests a certain stability in inflation, personal consumption expenditure posted strong figures. This outcome falls short of the Federal Reserve's expectations for a more restrained increase in inflation, creating fresh concerns for the Fed, which aims to curb inflation.

After briefly rebounding to the 146-yen range, the USD/JPY swiftly experienced a significant decline. Although U.S. Treasury yields decreased today, no specific selling factors were evident. It appears that the selling pressure in late August related to real demand around month-end carried over to London Fixing.

Market attention is now focused on tomorrow's U.S. employment statistics. This data release is expected to have a significant impact on the upcoming FOMC meeting. There are concerns that, without evidence of slowing wage growth, a soft landing may be unattainable. The Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) is anticipated to show an increase of 165,000 jobs, signaling a slowdown in the U.S. labor market. However, the situation regarding average hourly wages still indicates year-on-year growth in the 4% range.

The Euro to U.S. Dollar (EUR/USD) pair exhibited a consistent decline during London trading hours, briefly touching around 1.0840 dollars. This decline pushed it back to the 21-day and 100-day moving averages, making its future movements highly anticipated. The 200-day moving average is around 1.0815 dollars, serving as an immediate support level.

Today, we also received the August Eurozone Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), with both the overall and core indices exceeding expectations, posting a year-on-year increase of 5.3%. This exceeded forecasts due to base effects from last year and recent increases in oil prices, which led to a smaller-than-expected decline in energy prices. However, it's important to note that base effects from a 9-euro transport ticket in Germany last year could lead to further softening in the future. Despite this, as the labor market remains tight, a decline to levels matching the ECB's inflation target is still seen as a distant prospect.

Surprisingly, the Euro had a negative reaction to the better-than-expected HICP data. Even in the short-term financial markets, the likelihood of an ECB rate hike in the coming month, which was estimated at 40%, has decreased to 30%. This unexpected response appears to be linked to concerns about stagflation, given the growing worries about an economic downturn in the Eurozone. Schnabel, the ECB Executive Board member, commented today, stating that "the growth outlook has deteriorated more than the ECB forecasted in June, and underlying inflation remains stubbornly high."

The British Pound to U.S. Dollar (GBP/USD) pair also exhibited a consistent decline, with selling pressure prevailing. Following today's decline, it rebounded from the 21-day moving average, and market reactions to tomorrow's U.S. employment statistics are highly anticipated. The 100-day moving average is approaching the mid-1.26-dollar range, with market attention focused on whether this level will be breached.

Market expectations for additional rate hikes by the Bank of England (BoE) remain high. The BoE initiated the current rate hike cycle earlier than the Federal Reserve, but it is expected to conclude its rate hike cycle later than the Fed or the ECB. A 0.25% rate hike is expected at the next meeting in September; however, it's worth noting that short-term financial markets have not fully priced in this hike, with expectations at around 90%. While there was once speculation of a substantial 0.50% rate hike, concerns about an economic downturn have made the market more cautious.

Today, we heard from Philip, the Chief Economist at the Bank of England, who commented that "UK interest rates should remain at a moderately high level for some time, rather than rising rapidly and then falling rapidly afterward." This has led to a further decline in rate hike expectations.
