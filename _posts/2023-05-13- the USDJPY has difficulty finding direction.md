##  "On the recent situation where the dollar-buying and yen-buying are crossing, the USDJPY has difficulty finding direction."

The Bank of England (BOE) raised the policy interest rate as expected by 25bp (0.25% point) to 4.50%. The minutes of the meeting revealed that the decision to raise rates was passed by 7 to 2 votes, with two MPC members arguing for unchanged rates. It was reiterated that further policy tightening would be necessary if there is evidence that inflationary pressures will persist. In a subsequent press conference, Governor Bailey stated that stable low inflation is the foundation of a healthy economy and that maintaining the policy stance is necessary to ensure that the inflation rate returns to the target of 2%.

Although the pound was bought, the rise was temporary as the rate hike had already been factored in. However, in a media interview, Governor Bailey stated that the interest rate level is approaching a point where a pause in rate hikes may be possible.

In April, the US Producer Price Index (PPI) rose +2.3% YoY, and Core PPI, which excludes food and energy, slowed to +3.2% YoY. Both figures were below market expectations (+2.5%, +3.3%, respectively), and new US jobless claims increased to 264,000, surpassing market expectations (245,000), reaching the highest level since October 2021, which strengthened the view that rate hikes would be put on hold in June and caused the dollar to fall.

While the New York Dow fell by more than 400 points at one point, US stocks continued to decline, with the dollar-buying dominating over yen-buying in the forex market as a risk-aversion measure. Although the USD/JPY has rebounded, the movement of the cross-yen continued to be weighed down by the upper limit. In addition, the stock price of US regional bank Pacific West Bancorp fell by approximately 23% due to a 9.5% ($1.5 billion) decrease in deposits during the week until May 5.

The USD/JPY rebounded after hitting a one-week low last week. Although it fell to around 133.74 yen, the lowest level since May 4, due to the slowdown in the US Producer Price Index (PPI) and the increase in new US jobless claims, it recovered to the mid-134 yen level as the US long-term interest rates stopped falling. The relative strength of the dollar also supported the USD/JPY as the pound and the euro fell due to overbought positions. In addition, it became clear that funds were continuing to flow out of some US regional banks, and a meeting between the President and the Speaker of the House of Representatives over the debt ceiling issue was scheduled for the following week.
