## S&P500 TRADE

INVESTMENT OF BEST COMPANIES IN THE U.S. WITH XM, YOU CAN TRADE FROM A SMALL AMOUNT.
MOREOVER, IT CAN BE TRADED LIKE FOREX.
 
### What is S&P500 (=US500)

The S&P500 is one of the representative stock indices in the United States, along with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (US30) and Nasdaq (US100).

Unlike other overseas Forex, XM has spot and futures even with the same S&P500, each with advantages and disadvantages.

The stock index of 30 representative US companies is the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the S&P500 is a stock index of 500 companies.

Since many companies are covered, it can be said that it is a stock index that reflects the US economy more strongly.

And even in the present of the corona wreck, we are updating the highest price every day.

It is very popular as an investment target for many investors, and many investors are actually accumulating profits, and it is said that the S&P 500 will continue to rise as long as the US economy is doing well.

Even those who have never touched on stock prices can trade XM like an FX currency pair, but let's take a closer look at the "S&P500".

### S&P500 FOR RISK DIVERSIFICATION INVESTMENT

The constituent stocks are very well-balanced, which is one of the reasons for its popularity.

Many other companies are included in the S&P 500.

The S&P 500 has a wide variety of industries and a good balance, so it has the advantage of diversifying risk compared to individual stock investment .

There is an image that many assets are required to handle stocks in stocks.

However, XM's S&P500 (US500) is recommended because you can start trading even with a small amount.

Next, let's see if it is possible to trade the "S&P500" with XM even with a small amount.

SMALL INVESTMENT WITH XMPOSSIBLE
Small investment image

The leverage when trading S&P500 (US500) at XM is different from FX's "1000 times",Hundredfold” applies.

However, since the target of investment is a major American company, it is possible to aim for a large profit with a small fluctuation even in a short-term trade.

Now let's take a step-by-step look at how to trade the S&P500.

S&P500 (US500)TRADING PROCEDURE
S&P500 (US500) trade procedure image

Start MT4 → XM's currency pair list "CFD Cash > US500-Cash" "CFD Futures > US500-SEP21"

" after US500SEPs” is the English acronym that indicates the contract month. (September)

The last "21" indicates the last two digits of the year. (2021)

Please note that it is not a date.

POINT
FX currency pairs and lot numbers are different. For FX trading, 1.0 lot is 100,000 currency, but for US500, the minimum trading volume is 1.0 lot, and the profit and loss calculation method is different.

I think you'll understand when you check the procedure, but isn't it easier than you thought?

Next, let's check the trading hours of the S&P500 (US500).

TRADING HOURS

The trading hours for the S&P 500 on XM are as follows:

Summer time: Monday 06:05 to Saturday 04:10
Winter hours: Monday 07:05 - Saturday 05:10
There is also maintenance time, so please check the details from the link below.

Now, let's take a look at the formula for calculating the amount of margin actually required.

We recommend that you check how much assets you need before trading as a guide.

REQUIRED MARGINFORMULA TO FIND
Image of calculation formula for required margin

The formula for calculating the required margin is as follows.

S&P500 entry price x number of lots x 1%
S&P500 margin requirement = 1%


Example 2

10 lot sell entry when S&P500 price is $4,000

4,000 (USD) x 10.0 (lot) x 0.01 (1%) = 400 USD (40,000 yen)
required margin → 40,000 yen (400 USD)

Because it is XM, you can start with a very low margin, so it is recommended to start with a small amount.

Next, let's look at the difference between "actual" and "future".

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CASH AND FUTURES
Image of difference between spot and futures

There are two types of CFDs on XM: spot and futures.

the actual thing

Possibility of long-term holding
No deadline
futures

Contract month: position is liquidated when it expires
There is no expiration date for the actual product and it can be held for a long period of time, so it can be said that the trading sense is similar to Forex.

On the other hand, since futures are contract months, it is necessary to be careful as the position will be forced to close on the expiration date.

Below is a comparison table for easy understanding.

THE ACTUAL THING  FUTURES
Spread  narrow  About twice as much as the actual product
dividend adjustment can be  none
swap point  can be  none
Settlement deadline (contract month)  none  can be
POINT
After the due date, the trading chart itself cannot be displayed on MT4/5.

Next, let's take a closer look at the "Spot" and "Futures" of the S&P500 (US500) based on the above comparison table.

THE REAL THINGNARROW SPREADS
Image that the spread is narrower for the actual product

Spots have tighter spreads than futures.

In the case of US500, swap points and dividend adjustments are granted and collected for the spot, but the spread is narrow.

POINT
When trading across dates, futures are overwhelmingly more profitable in terms of transaction costs.

Next, let's look at dividend adjustments and swap points.

CASH ONLY SWAP POINT& DIVIDEND ADJUSTMENT

dividend adjustment

In CFD trading, you can receive dividend adjustment money in the same way as dividends obtained in actual stock trading.

“Buying” the spot → Granting of dividend adjustment money
“Selling” the actual item → Collecting the dividend adjustment money
POINT
In XM, both "buy" and "sell" are negative swaps in the case of the spot of S&P500 (US500).

Now, let's see which is better, "Spot" or "Futures", depending on your trading style (day trading/swing trading).

Just be careful to trade without forgetting the deadline.

Zero cut systemfeel safe in

Safe image with zero cut system

At XM, the zero cut system is applied to CFD trading as well as FX trading.

In CFD trading, as in FX trading, the window may open wide at the beginning of the week, so even if you focus on scalping, if you do not have a zero cut system for trades that span the week,MarginIt is not safe because there will be a payment obligation due to ".

In domestic FX, this "Margin” may cause you to pay more than you lost, but with XM you don’t have to worry about it.

Merit 3

separate trading accountsno need

invalid account image

Domestic Forex companies and many securities companies also offer Forex and CFD trading, but each account is separate.

Even if you have opened an account for stocks, gold or silver, you need to apply for another account again to start FX trading or CFD trading.

Moreover, since it is operated for each account, the margin cannot be shared, which is inconvenient and costly.

With XM, you can of course share the margin with the same account, and there is no need to apply for creating a new account.
