"The USD/JPY pair is currently trading in the lower 140 yen range, signaling a temporary pause in the rally of the US dollar"

In the London market, the previous upward momentum of the US dollar has waned. Following a peak in dollar buying from the Tokyo market, the prevailing trend has shifted towards dollar selling, coinciding with a decline in US bond yields. During early morning trading in London, the USD/JPY pair briefly touched 140.93, slightly surpassing the previous day's high. However, the announcement of an information exchange meeting among the Ministry of Finance, the Financial Services Agency, and the Bank of Japan led to a sharp drop to the lower 140 yen range. During the subsequent press conference, Financial Minister Kanda affirmed their commitment to closely monitor exchange rate movements and take appropriate measures if necessary. Although specific levels were not mentioned and the emphasis was placed on the significance of fluctuations, there was no perceived urgency in the market for immediate intervention. Consequently, the pair experienced a temporary rebound to the upper 140 yen range. Nevertheless, amidst the prevailing trend of overall dollar weakness due to declining US bond yields, the pair has softened, hovering just below the 140 yen level.

EUR/USD is exhibiting oscillatory behavior. After initially declining to around 1.0673, the pair reversed course and reached a peak around 1.0736. Similarly, GBP/USD faced a decline to approximately 1.2327 before shifting upwards and extending its high to around 1.2430. This dynamic reflects a selling pressure on the euro and a buying pressure on the pound. The sluggish growth reported in Spain's May consumer price index, which came in below expectations, has been identified as a contributing factor to the selling pressure on the euro. While GBP/JPY reached a new high around 174 yen, EUR/JPY has remained within the range of 149.75 and 150.60, exhibiting significant fluctuations.

The USD/JPY pair is currently trading in the lower 140 yen range. Supported by a strengthening buying trend during the afternoon session in Tokyo, the pair climbed to around 140.93 during early morning trading in London. However, as reports emerged of an information exchange meeting among the Ministry of Finance, the Financial Services Agency, and the Bank of Japan scheduled for 5:30 pm, yen buying pressure intensified rapidly. Apprehensions regarding potential measures to curb yen appreciation were observed. As a result, the pair dipped to approximately 140.10. Additionally, against the backdrop of declining US bond yields, market participants awaited the press conference by Financial Minister Kanda. However, the minister refrained from signaling a strong yen depreciation measure or immediate intervention. Consequently, the USD/JPY pair rebounded to the mid-140 yen range. However, considering the timing of the information exchange meeting, further upward movement was restrained. At present, the pair is experiencing downward pressure, approaching just below the 140 yen level due to the decline in US bond yields.


EUR/USD is currently trading within the higher 1.07 range, reflecting its resilient stance amidst market fluctuations. After encountering a temporary dip to approximately 1.0673 during the early London session, influenced by a lackluster trend emanating from the Tokyo market, the pair experienced a further downturn triggered by the announcement of Spain's May consumer price index, which exhibited slower-than-anticipated growth. Nevertheless, the pair swiftly regained its footing, propelled by the decline in US bond yields, and now hovers comfortably within the 1.07 range. Meanwhile, EUR/JPY is subject to significant fluctuations, mirroring the dynamics of its USD/JPY counterpart. Initiating the early London session with a high around 150.63, the pair rapidly retreated to approximately 149.75. However, bolstered by renewed buying interest as USD/JPY regained momentum, it rebounded to approximately 150.50. Selling pressure on the euro continues to dominate in comparison to the pound, illustrating the prevailing sentiment within the market.

The GBP/USD pair currently resides near the pivotal 1.24 level, poised for further developments. Although the Tokyo market limited its upward movement to the higher 1.23 range, the pair experienced a decline during the early London session, reaching around 1.2327. Nevertheless, the subsequent surge in buying pressure swiftly overturned the decline, propelling the pair back to the higher 1.23 range and even surmounting the 1.24 level. GBP/JPY has also been subject to pronounced fluctuations, exhibiting a decline from the upper 173 yen range to below 173 yen, followed by a resurgence in buying interest. Upon surpassing the critical level of 173.50, buying pressure intensified, catapulting the pair to the 174 yen level. Conversely, EUR/GBP demonstrated weakness, declining from approximately 0.8670 to around 0.8640. While the pound lacks substantial intrinsic support, the prevailing buying pressure against the euro serves as a stabilizing force, providing an underpinning for its current standing.
