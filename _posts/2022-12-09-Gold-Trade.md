Due to the large number of US traders that characterize gold, the greatest volatility occurs during US indicator releases and US market openings.

When trading with gold, be sure to trade with the above three timings in mind.

Next, let's take a closer look at the features of GOLD.

FEATURES OF GOLD

In the event that the world economy becomes unstable, which is called “geopolitical risk,” gold is chosen as an asset to avoid risk.

It is often called "emergency gold" that "anxiety in the global economy = increased demand for gold (risk off)" often holds true, so when trading gold, be aware of geopolitical risks in particular. is important.

Of course, it is important to be aware of the above risks even in XM FX trading, but in the case of gold, fluctuations are extremely rapid, so be especially aware.

Gold feature 3

USD and goldcorrelated

Gold is strongly positioned as a safe asset, so when the value of gold rises, the price of the risk-on currency, the US dollar, often falls.

Conversely, when USD/JPY is in an upward trend (the value of the US dollar is high and the value of the Japanese yen is low), the price of gold tends to fall.

Therefore, by checking the USD/JPY chart, you can make a judgment about gold's movement.

The total amount of gold that has been excavated all over the world so far is actually 180,000 tons, equivalent to three competition pools, and the unmined gold (gold) remaining in the ground is 53,000. It's called a ton.

Next, let's check the countries with large reserves of gold.

OF GOLDCOUNTRIES WITH LARGE RESERVES
Countries with large gold reserves in 2020 are as follows.

RANK  COUNTRY NAME  RESERVES (TONS) (2020)
First place Australia 10,000

In addition, it is used as a material for industrial products and electrical appliances, and it is difficult to imagine that the number of electronic devices will decrease in the future, so it is thought that the demand for gold will continue to increase.

Since the remaining amount to be mined is limited, it is highly likely that the price of gold, which is likely to become scarcer in the future, will rise in the long term.

In addition, central banks and public institutions around the world are accumulating gold holdings as foreign currency reserve assets.

Total holdings in 2021 are inflated for the first time in 31 years since 1990.

In contrast to the increasing presence of gold in reserve assets, the presence of the dollar has been steadily declining .

In the 50 years since then President Nixon announced in 1971 that the exchange of gold and the dollar would be suspended, the value of the dollar has decreased to about 1/50th of its original value. The money supply has increased about 30 times in 50 years.

POINT
President Nixon's announcement to stop the exchange of gold and the dollar triggered a change in the exchange market from a fixed exchange rate system based on the dollar that can be exchanged for gold to a floating exchange rate system. (Nixon Shock)

Currently, there is a view that gold can withstand turmoil in the world's financial markets because it is not directly connected to the economy of any country. Emerging market central banks with weaker reserves are turning to gold to protect their assets.

As mentioned above, the number of traders who trade gold on XM is increasing year by year, partly because gold is a stock with future potential and partly because it is easy to predict.

Compared to FX currency, gold trading can increase assets in an overwhelmingly short time, but conversely, even when you suffer a loss, gold trading is fast, so let's trade carefully.

So far, we have looked at the "gold (GOLD) trading" in detail.

Finally, let's take a look at the "summary" about gold trading at XM.

SUMMARY: GOLD TRADING
Gold transaction summary image

At XM, it is possible to trade Gold with high leverage in the same way as FX.

Gold (GOLD) is also compatible with scalping, so it is recommended because there are many opportunities to make a big profit.

What you need to be careful about when trading with gold (GOLD) is that the volatility is very high, so losses may increase at once.

Even though there is XM's zero cut system, be sure to cut losses, manage risk properly, and trade gold with peace of mind.

While the seven major countries (G7) have banned the import of gold from Russia as sanctions against Russia that invaded Ukraine, there is a strong view that the short-term impact will be limited, but the medium- to long-term impact will be gold. There is also the possibility that countries that are concerned about the liquidity of gold will lose their willingness to purchase gold and that the number of buyers in the market will decrease, which will have a major impact on central banks, institutional investors, and individuals holding gold in Europe and the United States.

However, for now gold trading still has the potential to generate greater profits with less capital than trading other Forex currencies.

Gold trading at XM is one of the most attractive trading styles.
