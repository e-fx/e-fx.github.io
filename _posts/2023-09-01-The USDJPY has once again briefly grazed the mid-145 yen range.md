"The USD/JPY has once again briefly grazed the mid-145 yen range, undergoing a slight downturn"

In the current scenario of the New York foreign exchange market, the USD/JPY has once again briefly grazed the mid-145 yen range, undergoing a slight downturn. This movement was predominantly catalyzed by the release of pivotal economic metrics, encompassing the ADP employment statistics and GDP revisions. These data indicators have not only underscored the anticipation of a moderated inflation rate but have also triggered a decline in U.S. Treasury yields, consequently escalating the selling pressure on the dollar.

The ADP employment statistics warrant special attention as they have reported a mere 177,000 increase in employment, falling short of consensus predictions and marking the lowest rise in five months. This deficiency in employment growth is a clear indicator of an ongoing softening in labor demand. Furthermore, the prior day's U.S. job openings report also depicted a weakening labor market, highlighting a gradual and persistent descent.

As the labor market gravitates towards a point of equilibrium between supply and demand, workers are gradually relinquishing some of the bargaining power accrued during the pandemic. This transition is accompanied by a declining perception of the U.S. labor market, leading to a reduction in voluntary resignations. Consequently, these dynamics are contributing to a deceleration in wage growth, with August wages for incumbent workers rising by a mere 5.9% year-on-year, marking the smallest increase since 2021. Conversely, wages for job switchers experienced a more robust increase, reaching 9.5%.

While the USD/JPY still finds support in the robust U.S. personal consumption, it is imperative to acknowledge the potential for a shift in market sentiment should labor market conditions deteriorate further. As a result, all eyes are fixated on the impending release of U.S. employment statistics scheduled for Friday. Currently, the nonfarm payroll (NFP) is anticipated to unveil an increase of 170,000 jobs, coupled with expectations of diminishing wage growth. Any results falling short of these expectations are poised to evoke a sensitive market reaction.

For traders holding long positions above the 145-yen threshold, it is crucial to consider the significant level near the August 23rd low of 144.54 yen, which serves as a critical stop level. From a technical standpoint, the 21-day moving average is converging around the 145-yen mark, attracting considerable attention.

In the context of the EUR/USD, a temporary rebound into the mid-1.09-dollar range has been observed. This week has witnessed a resurgence in the EUR/USD, supported by the 200-day moving average, with the currency pair successfully reclaiming the 21-day moving average. However, whether this resurgence heralds the commencement of a full-fledged rebound remains uncertain, contingent upon the dollar's response to forthcoming data releases, most notably the U.S. PCE deflator and Friday's employment statistics.

Today, we have also received preliminary consumer price index figures for Germany and Spain. Remarkably, Germany's inflation figures have defied initial expectations, showing less restraint, while conversely, Spain has exhibited an acceleration in its inflation rate. These data points have furnished the European Central Bank (ECB) with invaluable insights into the inflationary pressures within the Eurozone.

Looking forward, tomorrow is poised to deliver the Eurozone's comprehensive consumer price index. The data revealed today from Germany and Spain hint at the possibility of results surpassing expectations. ECB board members have consistently emphasized the pivotal role of consumer prices in shaping their forthcoming decision, slated for September 14th.

Market sentiment regarding a potential rate hike in September remains divided due to prevailing uncertainties. Should consumer prices persistently demonstrate an upward trajectory, the ECB may be inclined to lean towards a rate hike.

In the realm of the GBP/USD pairing, we have witnessed a resurgence in buying pressure, recapturing the 1.27-dollar range. With the reinstatement of the 21-day moving average, market focus now shifts to imminent developments in the coming days. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that there are relatively few sterling-related events on the horizon, with the dollar's movements in response to U.S. economic indicators poised to wield predominant influence.

Today, the Bank of England has released its Money and Credit report for July. The report unveils that savers have directed Â£10.1 billion into fixed-rate accounts. Market observers have emphasized that savers are favoring accounts offering the highest available interest rates, in anticipation of interest rates nearing their zenith. Consequently, they are securing higher yields with funds not expected to be needed for the next one to two years.
