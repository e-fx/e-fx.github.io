In addition, it is used as a material for industrial products and electrical appliances, and it is difficult to imagine that the number of electronic devices will decrease in the future, so it is thought that the demand for gold will continue to increase.

Since the remaining amount to be mined is limited, it is highly likely that the price of gold, which is likely to become scarcer in the future, will rise in the long term.

In addition, central banks and public institutions around the world are accumulating gold holdings as foreign currency reserve assets.

Total holdings in 2021 are inflated for the first time in 31 years since 1990.

In contrast to the increasing presence of gold in reserve assets, the presence of the dollar has been steadily declining .

In the 50 years since then President Nixon announced in 1971 that the exchange of gold and the dollar would be suspended, the value of the dollar has decreased to about 1/50th of its original value. The money supply has increased about 30 times in 50 years.

POINT
President Nixon's announcement to stop the exchange of gold and the dollar triggered a change in the exchange market from a fixed exchange rate system based on the dollar that can be exchanged for gold to a floating exchange rate system. (Nixon Shock)

Currently, there is a view that gold can withstand turmoil in the world's financial markets because it is not directly connected to the economy of any country. Emerging market central banks with weaker reserves are turning to gold to protect their assets.
