## Crypto currency at XM

Trading Cryptocurrency relaunched on XM with significantly improved trading conditions compared to before.

The new XM Crypto trading has a max leverage x250, and you can easily start trading crypto currencies even with a small amount of budget.

You can check the crypto currency CFD on the XM official website below.

Visit [XM Official Website](https://clicks.pipaffiliates.com/c?c=550036&l=en&p=0).


First of all, even if you are already trading crypto currencies at other brokers, including crypto currency exchanges, you will start using XM if you check the new conditions of XM.

## Pros and Cons


The pros of trading crypto currencies with XM are:

- Leverage up to x250

- Swap-free and no fees

- XMP (XM points)

- Tradeable on MT4/MT5

- Safe transaction because it is zero cut


#### Pros 1

Leverage up to x250

![placeholder](/assets/img/crypto/.jpg "Large example image")

XM's crypto currency CFDs have been leveraged from 5x before the resumption to 250x. With the increased maximum leverage, it is now possible to trade major crypto currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum from small amounts.

      <td>About 20,000 yen</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

As you can see from the comparison chart above, we have definitely evolved in all trading conditions.

It has not been announced why XM started trading crypto currencies that had been suspended, but it is a response to traders who want to trade crypto currencies using XM and new investors due to new trading conditions. You can see the aim to acquire .

When XM previously stopped handling crypto currencies, it was said to be to protect customers from too much volatility of crypto currencies.

It can be said that the crypto itself has become more stable than before that XM will start handling crypto again this time.

In any case, XM's crypto currency trading has been suspended since February 2019, but since May 24 2022, XM has renewed the trading conditions and has relaunched handling crypto currencies.

Compared to the previous XM crypto currency trading conditions, it is far more advantageous than other overseas Forex brokers and crypto currency exchanges.

I think that many users will enter crypto currency trading with XM in the future, so let's learn more about the new XM's crypto currencies.

		
Even while XM was suspending crypto currency, there were various changes in the crypto currency market, but now in 2022, in Japan, crypto currency trading has an upper limit of leverage, up to 2 times. It is

This is a simple calculation, and it requires a margin of approximately 2 million yen per 1 BTC.

With the new XM crypto currency trading conditions, the maximum leverage is 250 times, so the required margin is about 20,000 yen per 1 BTC, so it is possible to start trading with a surprisingly small amount of money.

#### Pros 2

swap free no fees

![placeholder](/assets/img/crypto/.jpg "Large example image")

crypto currency CFDs at XM are not only highly leveraged, but also “swap-free”.

For many crypto currency dealers, it is common for crypto currency CFDs to generate swap points such as leverage fees and fees when carrying over positions.

However, in the case of XM, there are no swap points and no fees.

Since many crypto currencies tend to move upward in price, swap-free trading and high leverage can be used to safely swing trade even with a small amount of money.

#### Pros 3

XM pointsAvailable

![placeholder](/assets/img/crypto/.jpg "Large example image")

With XM, you can trade not only crypto currencies, but also crypto currencies using points earned from trading currency pairs and other CFD stocks.

You can receive XM points up to 500,000 yen depending on the deposit amount and the new account opening bonus of 3,000 yen that you can receive if you open an account.

Of course, loyalty status is applied and XM points are awarded for each transaction, so it is also an advantage to be able to use points while trading crypto currencies.

#### Pros 4

Tradeable on MT4/MT5

![placeholder](/assets/img/crypto/.jpg "Large example image")

All stocks handled by XM, including crypto currencies, can be traded using the trading platform MT4/MT5.

MT4 and MT5 are standard for users familiar with overseas Forex, but they may not be very familiar to traders who mainly trade crypto currencies.

By using XM's MT4 / MT5 for crypto currency trading, you can easily perform automatic trading of crypto currencies including Bitcoin.

In particular, MT4 has excellent scalability and is characterized by the ability to handle many custom indicators and EAs (automatic trading).

In addition, both PC and MAC are supported, and you can trade from anywhere with tablets such as iPhone, Android, and of course iPad.

For detailed articles on MT4 & MT5, please see the following pages.

#### Pros 5

because it is a zero cutworry-free transaction

![placeholder](/assets/img/crypto/.jpg "Large example image")

In the crypto currency market, where prices fluctuate wildly, there are cases in which a large loss can result in a negative account balance and a large amount of debt.

However, XM has introduced a zero cut system in which XM bears the loss of the negative account balance for crypto currencies as well as other currency pairs and CFDs.

That's why you can trade with peace of mind that you don't have to worry about losing more than your deposit amount with XM, which doesn't have to bear the negative loss that would occur if it were a domestic crypto currency exchange.

See the following page for detailed articles on the zero cut system.

### Bitcoin (BTC/USD)

![placeholder](/assets/img/crypto/btc.jpg "Large example image")

BTC, the most famous crypto currency

Bitcoin was the first crypto currency created.

All altcoins are based on Bitcoin.

Unlike centralized management such as financial systems, it is a method called distributed ledger, in which the ledger is distributed and managed on the network.

It is specialized as a means of international payment and remittance because it is a common currency in the world, unlike the existing country management such as yen, euro, and dollar.

Since Bitcoin was created first among crypto currencies, it can be said that beginners can trade easily because of its high recognition and stability.

In addition, since Bitcoin is used as an actual payment currency, it is said that there is a good possibility that it will spread in daily life in the future. It seems that the number of users will be the largest in crypto currency trading at XM.

### Ethereum (ETH/USD)

![placeholder](/assets/img/crypto/eth.jpg "Large example image")


One of the features of Ethereum is the introduction of smart contracts (automatic contract technology).

Smart contracts allow transactions to be executed on the blockchain, enabling low-cost, immutable program transactions.

Since it is practically impossible to tamper with it, it also has the advantage of being protected from fraud such as being stolen by a person who is not the original owner.

In addition, Ethereum is constantly improving through regular updates, so it is expected that its value in the crypto currency market will continue to rise. It seems that many traders who also trade crypto currencies on XM will enter.

### Ripple (XRP/USD)

![placeholder](/assets/img/crypto/xrp.jpg "Large example image")


Also known as bridge currency, crypto currency specialized for settlement and remittance

Ripple is managed and operated by a US-based company called Ripple Inc.

A feature of Ripple is that it specializes in currency settlement and remittance.

Unlike the decentralized type such as blockchain used by many crypto currencies including Bitcoin, the existing centralized type is used.

In addition, Ripple is also called a "bridge currency" because it is characterized by low cost and relatively short time when remittances are made between different currencies.

Since it is actually adopted by the central bank of the country, represented by the Bank of England, it is promising as a future, so it is expected that the value will rise as the world pays attention in the future. Isn't it one of the crypto currencies that you can choose with confidence even in XM transactions?

### Litecoin (LTC/USD)

![placeholder](/assets/img/crypto/ltc.jpg "Large example image")

Altcoin released by former Google employee

Compared to Bitcoin, it is attracting attention because it is faster to complete transactions and can be settled with lower fees.

It is said that there is no doubt that Litecoin has a future since PayPal, a major American payment service, has introduced Litecoin as a settlement method, so it is expected to be watched as an important issue in crypto currency trading on XM. expected.

### Bitcoin Cash (BCH/USD)

![placeholder](/assets/img/crypto/bch.jpg "Large example image")

As the name suggests, it is a crypto currency derived from Bitcoin.

The so-called "scalability problem", in which remittance delays occur due to the increase in the number of traders, has become a serious problem with Bitcoin. It's cache.

Bitcoin Cash has a block size (data capacity) that is 32 times that of Bitcoin, so it greatly exceeds Bitcoin in terms of functionality.

As the number of brick-and-mortar stores accepting Bitcoin cash payments is increasing in each country, it is expected that the demand for Bitcoin cash will continue to grow in the future. XM crypto currency trading can be said to be a brand that can be traded with peace of mind, along with Bitcoin.

### Basic Attention Token (BAT/USD)

![placeholder](/assets/img/crypto/bat.jpg "Large example image")

Proprietary token developed by web browser Brave

Basic Attention Tokens can be earned by using the web browser "brave".

Brave has a function to block advertisements, etc., and has gained support from users all over the world from the viewpoint of privacy protection and high usability.

In the case of Japan, it is not possible to directly obtain crypto currency due to regulations, but it is possible to receive it as "BAT points".

BAT can be used as a tip when you want to support creators' works, and it will support creators and management.

Since it is linked with Youtube, it can also be used for Youtube video content.

If the number of users of brave increases in the future and the use of the currency itself increases, it is expected to become even more popular. I think there is no loss even if you pay attention to XM's crypto currency trading.

### OMG (OMG/USD)

![placeholder](/assets/img/crypto/omg.jpg "Large example image")

Fast processing and low cost based on Ethereum

One of OMG's features is the adoption of a security measure called Minimal Viable Plasma (MVP).

Previously, OMG could only be handled on overseas exchanges such as Binance, but between 2020 and 2021, we have achieved new listings on four domestic exchanges.

It depends on future trends, but if the price continues to rise, it may be possible to add it to the list as a target for crypto currency trading on XM.

### Cons of crypto currency TRADING AT XM


crypto currency at XM meets very attractive favorable conditions such as leverage and zero cut, and I think that the number of people using crypto currency for the first time will increase in the future.

However, it is important to be aware of not only the advantages but also the disadvantages before trading as much as possible.

The disadvantages of crypto currency trading at XM are as follows.

You can't actually hold currency
Loss cut/margin call common
Zero account is account opening bonus only

#### Cons 1

the actual currencycannot be held

Unlike crypto currency exchanges, XM does not allow you to actually buy and hold crypto currencies.

crypto currencies at XM are traded in CFDs (difference settlement transactions).

There is no need to be particularly conscious of trading because only the difference generated by the transaction is settled without actually buying and selling the actual product.

#### Cons 2

loss cutMargin call common

In crypto currency trading, forced loss cuts and margin calls are applied in the same way as other issues.

As with other currency pairs and CFD trades, XM triggers a margin call as a warning that the margin maintenance rate falls below 50%, and it becomes a forced loss cut when the margin maintenance rate falls below 20%. increase.

Of course, at XM, even if the account balance turns negative, the trader is protected by the zero cut system, so you can rest assured.

See the following page for detailed articles on the zero cut system.

It is a bonus that can be said to be one of the advantages of trading crypto currency with XM, but if you open a zero account with an XM account type, you can only receive a 3,000 yen bonus, so be aware in advance.

In the long run, we recommend choosing a standard account or a micro account, as you can enjoy many benefits.

So far, I have taken a closer look at “crypto currency trading” at XM.

Finally, let's check the "summary" about crypto currency trading.
