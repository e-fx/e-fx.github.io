"During the latter half of the afternoon, the USD/JPY pair displayed remarkable resilience, maintaining a strong foothold around the elevated 141 yen level"

The movement of this currency pair was significantly impacted by prevailing risk-averse sentiments, as evidenced by the extended decline of the Nikkei Average throughout the afternoon session. Consequently, there was a notable surge in demand for the yen as investors sought refuge from potential market volatility. This led to a temporary dip in the pair, reaching the 141.60 range. However, as the Tokyo trading session drew to a close, the downward momentum began to wane, facilitating a recovery to the 141.80 level. Today, market participants exercised prudence and refrained from adopting an aggressive trading approach in light of several upcoming events that carried significant implications. These events included the highly anticipated announcements of policy interest rates in Switzerland, Norway, the United Kingdom, and Turkey, as well as the congressional testimony of Federal Reserve Chairman Powell.

In the realm of the foreign exchange market, the EUR/USD pair demonstrated relative stability, with marginal fluctuations observed around the 1.0990 level. Conversely, the EUR/JPY pair faced downward pressure during the afternoon session, largely attributed to the strengthening yen, which arose as a consequence of the decline in Japanese stocks. Briefly touching approximately 155.62, the pair experienced limited losses before rebounding to the 155.80 level.

Turning our attention to the Australian dollar (AUD), we observed a subdued performance predominantly influenced by concerns surrounding China's economic slowdown, as well as a decline in after-hours trading of NYMEX crude oil. Given its status as a commodity-based currency, the Australian dollar encountered selling pressure in this environment. Consequently, the AUD/USD pair dipped to approximately 0.6757, while the AUD/JPY pair experienced a decline below the 96 yen level, briefly softening to around 95.78.
