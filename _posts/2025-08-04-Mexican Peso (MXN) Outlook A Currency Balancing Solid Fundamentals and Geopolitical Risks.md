### Starting Point in 2025: Strong Structural Support in the Mexican Economy
As of 2025, the Mexican Peso (MXN) remains one of the more resilient emerging market currencies. Several key factors underpin its current strength:

Manufacturing and Nearshoring Effects: Tensions between the U.S. and China, coupled with global supply chain restructuring, have driven American firms to shift production from Asia to Mexico. This trend has boosted Mexican exports to the U.S., reinforcing external demand and supporting stable economic growth.

Inflation Control and Policy Rates: After peaking in 2023–2024, inflation in Mexico is beginning to cool. The Bank of Mexico (Banxico) is signaling a cautious shift toward rate cuts. Despite this, interest rates remain relatively high, attracting short-term capital inflows and sustaining Peso demand.

### Geopolitical Risks: U.S. Presidential Election and Border Tensions
The upcoming U.S. presidential election in November 2025 will be a key potential volatility trigger for the Peso. Rising rhetoric around immigration, border security, and potential revisions to trade agreements could introduce risk premiums that pressure the currency.

Moreover, political instability in parts of Latin America—such as Venezuela and Ecuador—could indirectly dampen investor sentiment toward the region, increasing the Peso’s volatility as a regional proxy.

### Relationship with the U.S. Dollar: A Weakening Dollar as Tailwind
If the U.S. economy slows and expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts increase, the dollar may soften, providing a tailwind for the Peso. In such a scenario, carry trade dynamics could strengthen, with global investors seeking Mexico’s relatively high yields—leading to Peso appreciation against the dollar.

### Technical View & Investment Strategy
Technically, USD/MXN has shown signs of bottoming near the 17.0 level, with key resistance in the 16.5–16.3 range. A decisive break below this range could indicate a medium-term trend reversal. Should the Fed enter a full rate-cutting cycle, building long MXN positions may become an attractive trade for FX investors.

### Conclusion: Medium-Term Strength with Short-Term Caution
From both a macroeconomic and geopolitical perspective, the Peso remains a currency with solid upside potential in 2025. However, its sensitivity to U.S.-Mexico political developments and external shocks requires traders to remain vigilant. While medium-term appreciation seems plausible, short-term event risks must not be underestimated.
